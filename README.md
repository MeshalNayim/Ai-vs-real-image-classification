# AI Image Classification: Differentiating AI-Generated Images from Real Ones

This repository contains the code for my research project on AI Image Classification, where we differentiate AI-generated images from real ones using state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures such as ResNet50, EfficientNetB0, and DenseNet121. The project leverages the CIFAKE dataset and focuses on classification accuracy, precision, recall, and computational efficiency.

# Project Overview
This project aims to identify and classify AI-generated images using deep learning models. By comparing different CNN architectures, the goal is to find the most efficient and accurate model for distinguishing between AI-generated and real images.

The best-performing model, DenseNet121, achieved an accuracy of 98.49% in our experiments.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is CIFAKE, a dataset consisting of a mix of real and AI-generated images.

Dataset Name: CIFAKE
Classes: Real Images, AI-Generated Images
Dataset Size: 120,000 images


# Model Architectures
The following pre-trained CNN architectures were used in the project:

ResNet50
EfficientNetB0
DenseNet121
Each model was fine-tuned on the CIFAKE dataset to compare their performance in terms of

Classification accuracy
Precision
Recall
Computational efficiency
